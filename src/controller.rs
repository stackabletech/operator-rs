//! A way to implement a Kubernetes Operator on top of the [kube-rs](https://github.com/clux/kube-rs) library.
//!
//! This is an opinionated wrapper around the [`kube_runtime::Controller`] from said library.
//! The idea is that a single reconcile run can _and should_ be separated into lots of small steps
//! each taking the reconciliation one step towards a stable state.
//!
//! Every time the Operator changes any visible state in Kubernetes it should immediately return and requeue the resource.
//! The _requeue_ can happen immediately or after a custom duration.
//! The latter can be useful for operations that are expected to take a while (e.g. creating a resource which is under control by a different Operator).
//!
//! This module has a [`Controller`] which is the main object that drives the reconciliation loop.
//! Custom logic needs to be plugged in by implementing a [`ControllerStrategy`] trait.
//! The `Controller` will call `init_reconcile_state(...)` on the `ControllerStrategy` for every reconciliation that is triggered.
//! This method returns a `ReconciliationState` trait which can contain arbitrary state about this
//! specific reconciliation run.
//!
//! Once the state object has been created its `reconcile` method is called.
//! The `reconcile` method is where the business logic for each operator gets called.
//! `ReconcileFunctionAction`s can be used to chain multiple calls to separate methods.
//! By using the `then` method on `ReconcileFunctionAction` we can automatically abort and/or requeue
//! in case of an `Error` or a `ReconciliationFunctionAction::Requeue(duration)`.
//!
//! See the example below for how to use this abstraction in a real-world operator.
//!
//! # Example
