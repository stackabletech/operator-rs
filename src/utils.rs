///
/// Use the [`built`](https://crates.io/crates/built) crate and include it in your `main.rs` like this:
///
/// ```text
/// mod built_info {
///     // The file has been placed there by the build script.
///     include!(concat!(env!("OUT_DIR"), "/built.rs"));
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Then call this method in your `main` method:
///
/// ```text
/// stackable_operator::utils::print_startup_string(
///      built_info::PKG_DESCRIPTION,
///      built_info::PKG_VERSION,
///      built_info::GIT_VERSION,
///      built_info::TARGET,
///      built_info::BUILT_TIME_UTC,
