## Update and Release Workspace Members for Stackable Release XX.(X)X

> [!NOTE]
> During a Stackable release we update all dependencies in the `operator-rs`
> repository. After these bumps, each workspace member is released using an
> appropriate SemVer version. Later, each product operator repository can then
> use the updates crates.

### Tasks
- [ ] Update Rust version and workflow actions, see below for more details.
- [ ] Update Rust dependencies, see below for more details.
- [ ] Adjust and then verify crate versions using `.scripts/verify_crate_versions.sh`.
- [ ] Push the release tags using `.scripts/tag_and_push_release.sh`.
```

### Update Rust Version and Workflow Actions

> [!NOTE]
> The PR is usually titled: `chore: Bump Rust version and workflow actions`

1. Adjust the version of the channel in the `rust-toolchain.toml` file. See
   <https://releases.rs>.
2. Adjust the version `RUST_TOOLCHAIN_VERSION` in the workflows:
     - `.github/workflows/build.yml`
     - `.github/workflows/pre_commit.yaml`
3. Add a changelog entry.
4. Update any actions (using the Git commit hash) in the workflows. Hint: Also
   make sure that the `cargo-udeps` action is up-to-date, otherwise the CI might
   report errors.

### Update Rust Dependencies

> [!NOTE]
> This PR is usually titled: `chore: Bump Rust dependencies`

1. Bump minor versions of dependencies in the `Cargo.toml` manifest.
2. Then run the `cargo update` command.
3. Fix any code which needs updating due to the dependency bumps.
4. Locally update any product operator to identify any breaking changes
   downstream.
     - Hint: Use the `[patch."https://github.com/..."]` mechanism to temporarily
       override the dependency.
5. Add a changelog entry if required.

### Adjust and Verify Crate Versions

> [!WARNING]
> Currently, all workspace members use `0.X.Y` versions. This means we can
> introduce breaking changes in any version without needing to bump the major
> level. But we still have the following rules:
>
> - Breaking changes (internally and externally) will bump the minor level of
>   the version, so `0.X.Y` becomes `0.X+1.Y`.
> - All other non-breaking changes will bump the patch level of the version, so
>   `0.X.Y` becomes `0.X.Y+1`.
