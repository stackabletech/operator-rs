This is a simple Rust library that includes all kinds of helper methods, structs and enums that can be used to write a Kubernetes Controller/Operator with the [kube-rs](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs) crate.

It is part of the Stackable Data Platform, a curated selection of the best open source data apps like Apache Kafka, Apache Druid, Trino or Apache Spark, [all](#our-operators) working together seamlessly. Based on Kubernetes, Stackable is designed to run on prem or in the cloud.

## Documentation

This project is not featured in our main documentation documents. The code contains doc comments, and you can find explanations of high-level concepts
in the main documentation of the Stackable products at [docs.stackable.tech](https://docs.stackable.tech).

To see examples of how operator-rs is being used, take a look at the codebases of our [operator repositories](#our-operators).

## About The Stackable Data Platform

This operator is written and maintained by [Stackable](https://stackable.tech) and it is part of a larger data platform.

![Stackable Data Platform Overview](./.readme/static/borrowed/sdp_overview.png)

Stackable makes it easy to operate data applications in any Kubernetes cluster.

The data platform offers many operators, new ones being added continuously. All our operators are designed and built to be easily interconnected and to be consistent to work with.

The [Stackable GmbH](https://stackable.tech/) is the company behind the Stackable Data Platform. Offering professional services, paid support plans and custom development.

We love open-source!
