              Informs users about Listeners that are bound by a given Pod.

              This is not expected to be created or modified by users. It will be created by the Stackable Listener Operator when mounting the listener volume, and is always named `pod-{pod.metadata.uid}`.

                        Compared to `ingress_addresses` on the Listener status, this list is restricted to addresses that can access this Pod.
