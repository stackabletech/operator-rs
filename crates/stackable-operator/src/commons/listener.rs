//! This modules provides resource types used to interact with [listener-operator](https://docs.stackable.tech/listener-operator/stable/index.html)
//!
//! # Custom Resources
//!
//! ## [`Listener`]
//!
//! Exposes a set of pods, either internally to the cluster or to the outside world. The mechanism for how it is exposed
//! is managed by the [`ListenerClass`].
//!
//! It can be either created manually by the application administrator (for applications that expose a single load-balanced endpoint),
//! or automatically when mounting a [listener volume](`ListenerOperatorVolumeSourceBuilder`) (for applications that expose a separate endpoint
//! per replica).
//!
//! All exposed pods *must* have a mounted [listener volume](`ListenerOperatorVolumeSourceBuilder`), regardless of whether the [`Listener`] is created automatically.
//!
//! ## [`ListenerClass`]
//!
//! Declares a policy for how [`Listener`]s are exposed to users.
//!
//! It is created by the cluster administrator.
//!
//! ## [`PodListeners`]
//!
//! Informs users and other operators about the state of all [`Listener`]s associated with a [`Pod`].
//!
//! It is created by the Stackable Secret Operator, and always named `pod-{pod.metadata.uid}`.
