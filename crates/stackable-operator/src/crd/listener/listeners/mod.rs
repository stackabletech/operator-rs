//! This module provides resource types to interact with [`v1alpha1::Listener`]s and
//! [`v1alpha1::PodListener`]s.
//!
//! ## [`v1alpha1::Listener`]
//!
//! Exposes a set of pods, either internally to the cluster or to the outside world. The mechanism
//! for how it is exposed is managed by the [`v1alpha1::ListenerClass`][lc].
//!
//! It can be either created manually by the application administrator (for applications that expose
//! a single load-balanced endpoint), or automatically when mounting a [listener volume][lvb] (for
//! applications that expose a separate endpoint per replica).
//!
//! All exposed pods *must* have a mounted [listener volume][lvb], regardless of whether the
//! [`v1alpha1::Listener`] is created automatically.
//!
//! ## [`v1alpha1::PodListeners`]
//!
//! Informs users and other operators about the state of all [`v1alpha1::Listener`]s associated with
//! a [`Pod`].
//!
//! It is created by the Stackable Secret Operator, and always named `pod-{pod.metadata.uid}`.
//!
//! [lc]: crate::crd::listener::class::v1alpha1::ListenerClass
//! [lvb]: ListenerOperatorVolumeSourceBuilder
