              Exposes a set of pods to the outside world.

              Essentially a Stackable extension of a Kubernetes Service. Compared to a Service, a Listener changes three things:
              1. It uses a cluster-level policy object (ListenerClass) to define how exactly the exposure works
              2. It has a consistent API for reading back the exposed address(es) of the service
              3. The Pod must mount a Volume referring to the Listener, which also allows
                 ["sticky" scheduling](https://docs.stackable.tech/home/nightly/listener-operator/listener#_sticky_scheduling).

              Learn more in the [Listener documentation](https://docs.stackable.tech/home/nightly/listener-operator/listener).
