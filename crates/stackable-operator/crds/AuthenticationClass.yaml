              The Stackable Platform uses the AuthenticationClass as a central mechanism to handle user authentication across supported products.

              The authentication mechanism needs to be configured only in the AuthenticationClass which is then referenced in the product. Multiple different authentication providers are supported. Learn more in the [authentication concept documentation][1] and the [Authentication with OpenLDAP tutorial][2].

It is desirable to use `sub` in here (or some other stable identifier), but in many cases you might need to use `preferred_username` (e.g. in case of Keycloak) or a different claim instead.

                          Please note that some products hard-coded the claim in their implementation, so some product operators might error out if the product hardcodes a different claim than configured here.

                          We don't provide any default value, as there is no correct way of doing it that works in all setups. Most demos will probably use `preferred_username`, although `sub` being more desirable, but technically impossible with the current behavior of the products.
