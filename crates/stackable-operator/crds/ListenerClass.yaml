                  Configures a custom Service loadBalancerClass, which can be used to access secondary
                  load balancer controllers that are installed in the cluster, or to provision
                  custom addresses manually.

                  Ignored unless serviceType is LoadBalancer.

                description: |-
                  Whether or not a Pod exposed using a NodePort should be pinned to a specific Kubernetes node.

                  By pinning the Pod to a specific (stable) Kubernetes node, stable addresses can be
                  provided using NodePorts. The pinning is achieved by listener-operator setting the
                  `volume.kubernetes.io/selected-node` annotation on the Listener PVC.

                  However, this only works on setups with long-living nodes. If your nodes are rotated on
                  a regular basis, the Pods previously running on a removed node will be stuck in Pending
                  until you delete the PVC with the pinning.

                  Because of this we don't enable pinning by default to support all environments.

                  Whether addresses should prefer using the IP address (`IP`) or the hostname (`Hostname`).
                  Can also be set to `HostnameConservative`, which will use `IP` for `NodePort` service types, but `Hostname` for everything else.

                  The other type will be used if the preferred type is not available.

                  Defaults to `HostnameConservative`.

                  Service Internal Traffic Policy enables internal traffic restrictions to only route internal
                  traffic to endpoints within the node the traffic originated from. The "internal" traffic
                  here refers to traffic originated from Pods in the current cluster. This can help to reduce
                  costs and improve performance. See [Kubernetes docs][k8s-docs].

                  In the `serviceOverrides` property you can define a

                  to override any property that can be set on a Kubernetes Service.

                  This mechanism is similar to the `podOverrides`, which are documented in the
                  [Pod overrides documentation](https://docs.stackable.tech/home/nightly/concepts/overrides#pod-overrides).
