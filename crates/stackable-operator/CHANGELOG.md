[#719]: https://github.com/stackabletech/operator-rs/pull/719
[#721]: https://github.com/stackabletech/operator-rs/pull/721

## [0.61.0] - 2024-01-15

- Add generic types for `TryFrom<BTreeMap<K, V>>` impl ([#714]).

[#711]: https://github.com/stackabletech/operator-rs/pull/711
[#714]: https://github.com/stackabletech/operator-rs/pull/714
[#715]: https://github.com/stackabletech/operator-rs/pull/715

## [0.60.1] - 2024-01-04

### Fixed

- Let `ldap::AuthenticationProvider::add_volumes_and_mounts` also add the needed TLS volumes. This functionality was removed in [#680] and causes kuttl tests to fail, as the ca-cert volume and mount where missing. This patch restores the previous behavior (of adding needed TLS volumes) ([#708]).

[#708]: https://github.com/stackabletech/operator-rs/pull/708

## [0.60.0] - 2024-01-03

### Added

- Add LDAP AuthenticationClassProvider `endpoint_url()` method so each operator doesn't have to construct it. ([#705])

[#705]: https://github.com/stackabletech/operator-rs/pull/705

## [0.59.0] - 2023-12-21 ðŸŒ²

### Added

- Add `stackble_operator::kvp` module and types to allow validated construction of key/value pairs, like labels and
  annotations. Most users want to use the exported type aliases `Label` and `Annotation` ([#684]).

### Changed

- Move `stackable_operator::label_selector::convert_label_selector_to_query_string` into `kvp` module. The conversion
  functionality now is encapsulated in a new trait `LabelSelectorExt`. An instance of a `LabelSelector` can now be
  converted into a query string by calling the associated function `ls.to_query_string()` ([#684]).
- BREAKING: Remove legacy node selector on `RoleGroup` ([#652]).

[#684]: https://github.com/stackabletech/operator-rs/pull/684
[#652]: https://github.com/stackabletech/operator-rs/pull/652

## [0.58.1] - 2023-12-12

### Added

- More CRD documentation ([#697]).

[#697]: https://github.com/stackabletech/operator-rs/pull/697

## [0.58.0] - 2023-12-04

### Added

- Add `oidc::AuthenticationProvider`. This enables users to deploy a new `AuthenticationClass` for OIDC providers like
  Keycloak, Okta or Auth0 ([#680]).
- Add a common `ClientAuthenticationDetails` struct, which provides common fields and functions to specify
  authentication options on product cluster level. Additionally, the PR also adds `ClientAuthenticationConfig`,
  `oidc::ClientAuthenticationOptions`, and `ldap::ClientAuthenticationOptions` ([#680]).

### Changed

- BREAKING: Change the naming of all authentication provider structs. It is now required to import them using the
  module. So imports change from `...::authentication::LdapAuthenticationProvider` to
  `...::authentication::ldap::AuthenticationProvider` for example ([#680]).
- BREAKING: Move TLS related structs into the `tls` module. Imports need to be adjusted accordingly ([#680]).

### Fixed

- Fixed appVersion label in case container images contain a hash, such as `docker.stackable.tech/stackable/nifi@sha256:85fa483aa99b9997ce476b86893ad5ed81fb7fd2db602977eb8c42f76efc109`. Also added a test-case to ensure we support images containing hashes. This should be a rather cosmetic fix, images with hashes should have worked before anyway ([#690]).

[#680]: https://github.com/stackabletech/operator-rs/pull/680
[#690]: https://github.com/stackabletech/operator-rs/pull/690

## [0.57.0] - 2023-12-04

### Changed

- BREAKING: The `CustomResourceExt` functions now take the Operator version as an argument.
  It replaces `DOCS_BASE_URL_PLACEHOLDER` in doc strings with a link to URL base, so
  `DOCS_BASE_URL_PLACEHOLDER/druid/` turns into `https://docs.stackable.tech/home/nightly/druid/`
  in the nightly operator ([#689]).

[#689]: https://github.com/stackabletech/operator-rs/pull/689

## [0.56.2] - 2023-11-23

### Added

- More documentation for CRD structs ([#687]).

[#687]: https://github.com/stackabletech/operator-rs/pull/687

## [0.56.1] - 2023-11-23

### Changed

- Update `kube` to `0.87.1` as version `0.86.0` was yanked ([#685]).

[#685]: https://github.com/stackabletech/operator-rs/pull/685

## [0.56.0] - 2023-10-31 ðŸ‘»

### Added

- Added `COMMON_BASH_TRAP_FUNCTIONS`, which can be used to write a Vector shutdown trigger file after the main
  application stopped ([#681]).

### Changed

- BREAKING: Rename `product_logging::framework::shutdown_vector_command` to `create_vector_shutdown_file_command` and
  added `remove_vector_shutdown_file_command` ([#681]).
- BREAKING: Remove re-export of `product_config`, update `product_config` to `0.6.0` ([#682]).

### Fixed

- Fix Docker image tag parsing when user specifies custom image ([#677]).

[#677]: https://github.com/stackabletech/operator-rs/pull/677
[#681]: https://github.com/stackabletech/operator-rs/pull/681
[#682]: https://github.com/stackabletech/operator-rs/pull/682

## [0.55.0] - 2023-10-16

### Added

- Mark the following functions as `const` ([#674]):
  - `ClusterResourceApplyStrategy::delete_orphans`
  - `LdapAuthenticationProvider::default_port`
  - `LdapAuthenticationProvider::use_tls`

  - `MemoryQuantity::from_mebi`
  - `ClusterCondition::is_good`
  - `ClusterOperationsConditionBuilder::new`
  - `commons::pdb::default_pdb_enabled`
- Add interoperability between the `time` crate and the `stackable_operator::time::Duration` struct. This is opt-in and
  requires the `time` feature to be enabled. Additionally, adds `Add`, `AddAssign`, `Sub`, and `SubAssign` operations
  between `Duration` and `std::time::Instant`. Further adds a new helper function `Duration::now_utc` which calculates
  the duration from the unix epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00) until now ([#671]).

### Changed

- BREAKING: Rename top-level `duration` module to `time`. Imports now use `stackable_operator::time::Duration` for
  example ([#671]).
- Convert the format of the Vector configuration from TOML to YAML ([#670]).
- BREAKING: Rename `PodBuilder::termination_grace_period_seconds` to `termination_grace_period`, and change it to take `Duration` struct ([#672]).

  be compatible with Vector version 0.31.0. The product image must
  contain Vector 0.31.x ([#625]).

### Fixed

  ROOT logger was set to TRACE and the level of the file logger was set
  to DEBUG then TRACE logs were written anyway ([#625]).
