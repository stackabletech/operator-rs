# Testing the `#[versioned]` macro

This folder contains both snapshot and compile (trybuild) tests. Both types of tests use the same
set of input files to both ensure the macro generates the expected code and either compiles or
produces the expected compile error.

Tests are currently separated into two folders: `default` and `k8s`. The default test cases don't
require any additional features to be activated. The Kubernetes specific tests require the `k8s`
feature to be enabled. These tests can be run with `cargo test --all-features`.

## Snapshot Testing

> [!NOTE]
> Please have `rust-src` installed, e.g. using `rustup component add rust-src`.
>
> Also see the compile-fail tests, described [here](#compile-fail-testing).

Snapshot testing is done using the [insta] crate. It provides a [CLI tool][insta-cli] calle
 `cargo-insta` and a [VS Code extension][insta-ext].

Test inputs and snapshots of the expected output are located in the `inputs` and `snapshots` folder
respectively. Each Rust attribute macro expects two inputs as a token stream:

> The first TokenStream is the delimited token tree following the attributeâ€™s name, not including
> the outer delimiters. If the attribute is written as a bare attribute name, the attribute
> TokenStream is empty. The second TokenStream is the rest of the item including other attributes on
> the item.
>
> _(Taken from the [Rust reference][rust-ref])_

Because of that, a special delimiter is used in the input files which separates different sections
of the input file while still enabling developers to write valid Rust code. The delimiter is
`// ---\n`. Most of the inner workings are located in [this file](../src/test_utils.rs).

```rust
use stackable_versioned::versioned;
// --- <- See here!
#[versioned(
    version(name = "v1alpha1"),
    version(name = "v1beta1"),
    version(name = "v1")
)]
// --- <- See here!
pub(crate) struct Foo {
    #[versioned(
        changed(since = "v1beta1", from_name = "jjj", from_type = "u8"),
        changed(since = "v1", from_type = "u16"),
    )]
    bar: usize,
    baz: bool,
}
// --- <- See here!
fn main() {}

// Rest of code ...
```

Input files must include **three** separators which produce **four** distinct sections:

- Imports, like `stackable_versioned::versioned`
- The attribute macro
- The item the macro is applied to
- The rest of the code, like the `main` function

### Recommended Workflow

First, add new input files (which automatically get picked up by `insta`) to the `inputs`
folder. Make sure the delimiter is placed correctly between the different sections. Doc comments on
the container have to be placed after the delimiter. Next, generate the snapshot files (initially
not accepted) by running

```shell
cargo insta test -p stackable-versioned-macros --all-features
```

This command will place the new snapshot files (with a `.new` extension) in the `snapshots` folder.
These new snapshot files must not appear on `main`, but can be shared on branches for collaboration.
To review them, run the `cargo insta review` command, then accept or fix the snapshots. Once all are
accepted (ie: no `.new` files remaining), check in the files.

## Compile-Fail Testing

> [!NOTE]
> Also see the snapshot tests, described [here](#snapshot-testing).

This type of testing is part of UI testing. These tests assert two things: First, some code should
compile without errors and secondly other code should produce the expected rustc (compiler) error
message. For this type of testing, we use the [`trybuild`][trybuild] crate.
