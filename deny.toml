    # "rsa" crate: Marvin Attack: potential key recovery through timing sidechannel
    #
    # No patch is yet available, however work is underway to migrate to a fully constant-time implementation
    # So we need to accept this, as of SDP 25.3 we are not using the rsa crate to create certificates used in production
    # setups.
    #
    # https://github.com/RustCrypto/RSA/issues/19 is the tracking issue

    # The "paste" crate is no longer maintained because the owner states that the implementation is
    # finished. There are at least two (forked) alternatives which state to be maintained. They'd
    # need to be vetted before a potential switch. Additionally, they'd need to be in a maintained
    # state for a couple of years to provide any benefit over using "paste".
    #
    # This crate is only used in a single place in the xtask package inside the declarative
    # "write_crd" macro. The impact of vulnerabilities, if any, should be fairly minimal.
    #
    # See thread: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/paste-alternatives/126787/4
    #
    # This can only be removed again if we decide to use a different crate.
